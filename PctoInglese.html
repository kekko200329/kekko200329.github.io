    <h1> The Life </h1>
    <p>
      Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in London.
He was one of the fathers of computer logic as we know it today and was one of the first to take an interest in the problem of artificial intelligence. However, Turing, or the Prof as his neighbors called him, was anything but a model student. He was always scruffy and dirty, he often went to class in his pajamas, was not sociable and did not hesitate to abandon a conversation when he did not find it more interesting. In 1931 he entered King’s College, Cambridge. He was committed to passing the exam as a final tribute to his dear friend Christoper Morcom who had died of tuberculosis.</p>
<p> At Cambridge he had great teachers who were able to understand his whimsical genius. Also, thanks to a play, he was fascinated by the story of Snow White, which will mark his life.
In 1934 he graduated in mathematics with top marks. The following year he obtained a Phd and in 1936 he won an important prize. In that period Turing wrote his most famous article that would lead him to be one of the brightest scientists of his century: on the computable numbers with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem. The 'Entscheidungsproblem' or problem of the decisibility proposed by David Hilbert asked if it was always possible to understand whether a mathematical proposition is true or not. Turing solved the problem through the invention of an imaginary machine: the turing machine </p>
<p> Another scientist, Alonzo Church, had solved Hilbert’s question through a very complicated work and, having learned of Turing’s machine, invited him to Princenton. Turing accepted, but this experience soon came to an end because he found himself very uncomfortable in that place, surrounded by sacred monsters of science that did not even deserve a look; Only one of them approached him and it was von Neumann who proposed to him to become his assistant, but Turing preferred to return to England in 1938.
He brought with him from Princenton a strange cipher device built by himself capable of multiplying between them two long binary numbers, one was a plain text, the other the key; multiplying between them they gave a code. This was the beginning of his great passion for encryption codes. It was for this reason that he was hired by the British Secret Service to perform a major task against the Germans during the war by deciphering their Enigma code.
Thanks to his contribution, at the end of the war, in 1946, Turing was awarded a high military honor, the Order of the British Empire. </p>
<p> After the conflict Turing was hired by the National Phisical Laboratory (NPL) where he dedicated himself to the construction of his universal machine. He designed a real computer ACE (Automatic Computer Engine); however he was neither understood nor helped and therefore decided to return to Cambridge, but first he went to Manchester to work on the design of the machine MADAM (Manchester Automatic Digital Machine), developing its algorithms and programs. Turing was convinced that by the year 2000 computers could mimic the functioning of the human brain. In 1947, he returned to Cambridge, where he returned to work with enthusiasm, also interested in neurology and physiology.
Then he wrote an article titled Intelligent Machine, published in 1969, where he expressed the his idea that machines could be created to imitate human activity. </p>
<p> One little-known aspect of Turing’s latest research was that of biology. In 1952 he published an article in which Turing posed the problem of how it was possible that a single egg cell, which divides into other identical cells, could develop a child; however, research in this direction was never completed. In fact, other problems were in Turing’s head. After reporting a robbery in his home by two petty thieves, it was discovered that one of the two had had homosexual intercourse with Turing himself. On trial for obscene acts, Turing was forced to avoid prison to accept a hormonal treatment that would render him powerless. But this cure brought him to ruin. He was increasingly demoralized and depressed until he took a Extreme decision: to kill oneself by biting like Snow White a poisoned apple. It was June 7, 1954. In the medical report it was written: "cause of death: potassium cyanide self-administered at a time of mental imbalance"
Turing was undoubtedly one of the greatest pioneers in the field of computers. Today’s computer scientists still make references to his writings; however, in the new millennium Turing’s questions have not yet been answered.</p>

        <h1>
          The Turing Machine
        </h1>
        <p>
          The name of Turing is today famous mainly for its analysis of the computation process in terms of abstract machines, called Turing machines. To understand the importance of the Turing machine it is necessary to make a distinction between calculators and modern computers. The main difference between the two is that the calculators can perform a number of operations but cannot be programmed. The basic idea behind the programmable computer is that any kind of computation consists in the manipulation of symbols following a set of rules (algorithm). With this model comes the idea of "universal calculator". The Turing machine consists of a sliding paper tape divided into boxes, a nib and an appliance which is able to perform 4 operations: scroll the tape forward, backward, mark an empty box with an X, or delete one when it meets. Turing He understood that a machine so conceived, properly equipped with a program, had the potential to perform any action because it was able to learn. In practice, Turing’s intuition was that a machine like that could perform any operation was representable by an algorithm. It was a universal machine. The modern concept of how we now understand the computer was just born. Turing demonstrated that there was a class of problems to which the machine would not be able to give an answer and that therefore it is impossible to establish in a certain and mechanical way the truth or falsity of all mathematical utterances. Turing never built his "universal machine".
          The very concept of Turing machine demonstrates the reason for He is considered the founder of the functionalists; in fact, the machine must imitate only the processes and functions carried out by the mind. However, the scientist also deals with the problem of networks of logical structures, in=prsimulare in a purely theoretical way a human brain describing it as a "disorganized machine of type B".

<h1>
  The defeat of Enigma
</h1>
    <p> Allied agents during World War II were grappling with a seemingly unsolvable problem: Enigma.
Enigma was the machine used to encrypt secret messages by the Germans. The machine consisted of a series of rolls, a reflector and a manual connection table; all the scrolls moved continuously with extremely complex mechanics and, once a message was entered, it was encoded in such a way as to be incomprehensible to those who read it. The allies eventually decided to form a group of top-notch cryptanalysts, including Alan Turing. He, together with his collaborators, already in 1940 was able to build a machine capable of imitating Enigma. However, the traffic of secret messages could not yet be read in real time; after a short time Turing managed to make the machine faster and more effective by creating a new one, called 'the bomb' because of the continuous ticking. Thanks to this machine it was possible to read all the secret traffic of the Luftwaffe, the German air force. That of the navy was still impregnable. But Turing did not give up and managed to solve the problem by building a huge electromechanical device, the Colossus, capable of deciphering the German secret code. Thanks to these tools, from 1943 the allies were able to know in advance the moves of the German enemy: the war was won. At the end of the war, Turing was awarded a military honor by the British government; however, his enterprise remained secret for over thirty years.</p>
  <h1>
    The Turing test
  </h1>
  <p>
    A central theme in Turing's thoughts was that of the problems associated with mental activity. The Turing machine was only a very first step in the analysis of brain possibilities; the ACE project, in addition to war applications, also speaks of the universal machine as a brain. In fact, Turing openly affirms the possibility that his machine can play chess, can translate from one language to another, deal with mathematics or cryptography. In practice, Turing became the prophet of Artificial Intelligence: first he illustrated it and then defended it in numerous conferences, debates and articles. His theoretical contribution was an operational definition of thought, with the so-called Turing test: if a machine behaves indistinguishable from a person, then it thinks. It goes without saying that even today the only computers that passed the Turing test are found in science fiction novels.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The Turing test essentially consists in answering his initial question: “Can machines think?”. To answer this question, Turing reformulated it in terms of a game, which he called the 'imitation game'. This game is played by three people: a man (A), a woman (B) and an interrogator. The latter is locked in a room, divided from the other two, who are known by him with the names X and Y. The aim of the game is for the questioner to understand who the man is and who the woman is, asking questions to the two. So that nothing can help the questioner to understand who the man is and who the woman, the answers will be typed. A's purpose is to deceive the questioner, B's purpose is to help him. The Turing test is based on the belief that a machine replaces A, and in the event that the questioner does not notice anything, the machine should be considered intelligent, since it would be indistinguishable from a human being. For an intelligent machine Turing considers one that is able to think, that is, capable of producing ideas and thoughts linked together and expressing them. For Turing, therefore, it all boils down to the production of expressions that are not without meaning. However, the purpose of the Turing test is not only to answer the question of whether machines can think but also to push scholars to reflect on the question. Certain objections were raised about the effectiveness of this test, some brought by Turing himself. One of the most famous is that of which claimed that machines were incapable of originality; Turing replied that machines can surprise people, particularly when an event is new.
The Turing test was reformulated in the following years. The reasons are varied: from the original imprecise formulation, to the arising of new problems on the definition of intelligent machines. The philosopher John Searle, proposed a modification of the Turing test, which took the name of the Chinese room, believing that he was able to demonstrate that the Turing test was not sufficient to prove that a machine or a computer system are systems equipped with intelligence.
Even today, no artificial system has passed the Turing test, and prizes are given out every year to encourage programmers to build it.</p>
